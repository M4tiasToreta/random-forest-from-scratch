# random-forest-from-scratch

Fucking machine learning Random Forest Binary Classification model done from scratch with our bare hands @nates1803. 

- How to run it?
Install gcc and run 
´´´gcc main.cpp -o main.exe -lm´´´
then
´´´./main.exe´´´

The accurancy is still shit, it only works for the dataset uploaded(for now) and only binary classification.
